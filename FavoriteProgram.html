			<div class="description"><h2>Snake? 2.0?</h2>
			<p>Snake 1.0 is a simple game where you control a string of connected boxes, the "snake", that moves along a grid into different singular boxes, the "kibble". Each time the snake runs into a kibble the snake grows by a set number of boxes. If the front box of the snake, the "head" runs into one of the other boxes of the snake, the "tail", the game ends. If the head of the snake runs into the end of the grid, the game ends. If you get board and leave, the game ends.</p>
			
			<p> I started with a rather buggy version of Snake 1.0 and modified it into the vastly superior 2.0, which was also rather buggy but - and this is the important part - they were <span id="italic">different</span> bugs.</p> 
			<p>I added</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Special squares, the "walls", which end the game if the snake head runs into them! </li>
				<li> Textures! I drew a beautiful carpet pattern for the snake to move across, a python-like pattern for the snake, and mossy brick walls that in no way matched the carpet for the walls. </li>
				<li>Kibble types! Specifically:
					<ul>
					<li> NORMAL TYPE: This kibble resets the snake color. </li>
					<li> PINK TYPE: This kibble makes the snake pink! </li>
					<li> BLUE TYPE: This kibble makes the snake blue! </li>
					<li> GREEN TYPE: This kibble makes the snake green! </li>
					<li> SHRINKSQARES TYPE: This kibble makes the square size - of the snake, kibble, and grid - smaller! </li>
					<li> NYOOMTIME TYPE: This kibble makes the snake move faster! </li>
					<li> WALLMAGEDDON: This kibble changes the position of the walls! </li>
					<li> NEGATIVE SCORE: This kibble makes your score go down! You have no choice but to run into it unless you want to end the game! </li></li>
				<li> Bug fixes! </li>
				<li> New bugs! </li>
				<li> Fixes for some, but not all, of the new bugs! </li>
				<li> Some other stuff, probably! </li>
